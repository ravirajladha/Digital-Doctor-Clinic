            <div class="about-content">
                <p style="text-align:justify;">There are two main types of diabetes: type 1 and type 2.
Type 1 is an autoimmune disorder in which the body fails to produce insulin,
while type 2 is a metabolic disorder in which the body does not use insulin properly.
                </p>

                <p style="text-align:justify;">No matter which type of diabetes you have, it is important to take steps to manage it and stay healthy. Eating healthy foods, controlling portion sizes, and engaging in regular physical activity are all important parts of managing diabetes.
                </p>

                <p style="text-align:justify;">Additionally, for those with type 1 diabetes, it is important to monitor your blood sugar levels and take insulin as prescribed. Living with diabetes can be difficult, but support from family and friends is invaluable.
