                <p style="text-align:justify;">ECG (electrocardiogram) is a test that measures the electrical activity of the heart. It is conducted to detect any irregularities in the heart rhythm or structure, as well as any damage to the heart muscle. The test is conducted by attaching electrodes to the chest and limbs to measure the electrical activity of the heart in order to generate a graphical representation of the heart's activity. The ECG can provide information about the rate and regularity of the heartbeat, as well as any underlying problems such as arrhythmias, heart attacks, and other heart conditions.
