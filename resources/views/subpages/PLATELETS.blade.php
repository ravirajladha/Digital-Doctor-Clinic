                <p style="text-align:justify;">A platelets test is a blood test to measure the number of platelets in a person's body. Platelets are a type of cell in the blood that helps with blood clotting. The test will be conducted to measure the platelet count in order to diagnose or monitor conditions such as thrombocytopenia, a disorder that can cause excessive bleeding, or monitor the effectiveness of treatments.
                </p>
                <p style="text-align:justify;">The test is conducted by taking a sample of blood from the patient and sending it to a lab for analysis. The lab will then count the number of platelets in the sample, and the results will be reported in a number or range.
