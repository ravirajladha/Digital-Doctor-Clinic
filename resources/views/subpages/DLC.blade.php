                <p style="text-align:justify;">The Differential Leucocyte Count test is a test that measures the number and types of white blood cells in a sample of blood. White blood cells, or leucocytes, are an important part of the bodyâ€™s immune system and are involved in fighting off infections and diseases.
                </p>
                <p style="text-align:justify;">The Differential Leucocyte Count test is typically conducted to assess the level of inflammation in the body or to detect any underlying infections. It can also be used to monitor the effectiveness of certain treatments, such as chemotherapy.
                </p>
                <p style="text-align:justify;">The test is conducted by taking a sample of blood and counting the number of each type of white blood cell present. Different cell types are identified by their shapes and sizes, and the ratio of each type to the total number of cells is calculated. This result is then used to assess the level of inflammation in the body.
