               <p style="text-align:justify;">Anxiety is a normal emotion that we all experience from time to time. It's the feeling of fear, worry, and unease about an event or situation.
               </p>
               <p style="text-align:justify;">For some people, however, anxiety can become so intense and persistent that it can interfere with their daily life. Anxiety can manifest itself in many different ways. It can be physical, such as a racing heart, sweaty palms, and restlessness.
               </p>

               <p style="text-align:justify;">It can also be mental, such as racing thoughts and worries, or emotional, such as feelings of dread or hopelessness. It’s important to understand that anxiety can be a sign of something more serious, such as an anxiety disorder.
               </p>

               <p style="text-align:justify;">Anxiety disorders are the most common type of mental health disorder, affecting 40 million adults in the United States. Common anxiety disorders include generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder, and social anxiety disorder.
               </p>

               <p style="text-align:justify;">The good news is that anxiety is treatable. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is a type of psychotherapy that has been found to be effective in treating anxiety disorders. CBT helps people learn to change their thought patterns, behaviors, and reactions to anxiety-provoking situations. Medications can also be used to treat anxiety.
               </p>
               <p style="text-align:justify;">Common medications used to treat anxiety include antidepressants, anti-anxiety medications, and beta-blockers. It’s important to remember that everyone experiences anxiety differently and that there is no one-size-fits-all treatment. If you’re struggling with anxiety, it’s important to talk to a mental health professional to determine the best course of treatment
